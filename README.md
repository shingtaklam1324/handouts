# Handouts

These are some miscallaneous documents I have written, mainly for my own understanding. I've put them online just in case they end up being useful for other people.

- [Sylow's theorems](handouts/Sylow.pdf)
- [Homology](handouts/homology.pdf) - Warning this is still WIP, so far I've gotten to the Snake lemma.
- [Topological groups](handouts/TopologicalGroups.pdf)
